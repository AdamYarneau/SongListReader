# SongListReader
A python based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) program that grabs the artist and song names from a YouTube video using Tesseract OCR and writes the data to an auto generated text file. 

The current boundary box settings are configured to fit this video when played in theater mode. But the bounds can easily be adjusted for a different video.
